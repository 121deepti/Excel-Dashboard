# Consumer Lending Risk Profiling
As a data analyst I am provided with the <b>loan dataset</b> that provides a detailed snapshot of consumer lending, encompassing a wide array of information about individual loans. The objective of this project is to apply advanced data analysis techniques using <b>Excel</b> to deeply understand and effectively manage a <b>loan portfolio</b>.This involves assessing loan risk profiles, evaluating financial performance metrics, gaining insights into borrower behaviors, and ultimately, developing a comprehensive, interactive Excel dashboard. These efforts aim to provide strategic recommendations for optimizing loan portfolio management, mitigating risks, and enhancing decision-making processes for financial institutions and stakeholders in the consumer lending sector.
